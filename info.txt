Eveything is a widget.
Flutter uses a widget tree.
Flutter framework uses Dart (language)
Flutter has its own native code for android and iOS. 
pubsec defines dependencies for libraries etc.

every widget needs to extend StatelessWidget or stateful. It calls the build method.

Visible widgets (output and input) & invisible widgets (layout & control)

State of a widget:
    -> data/info used by widget
    -> you cant change state of StatelessWidget 
    -> StatefulWidget can have its state changes
    -> State is persistent. Hence it should be in another class.
    -> When State changes, the widget is rebuilt, but state is not rewritten.
    -> setState updates the Widget by calling its build method.

use a Container widget to wrap other widgets
    -> Margin | Border | Padding | child
